# AI Usage Disclaimer

We used AI to help brainstorm creative names and slogans based on our app's purpose—tracking spending and building better habits. After getting different suggestions, we narrowed it down to 5 options, discussed them as a group, and picked the best name + slogan together. We also checked the App stores to make sure that our name is unique. 

AI also helped check grammar since English is the fourth language for one of our developers. 

Using AI taught us that it's a great brainstorming friend as it gives us ideas fast, but the human touch (discussing, debating, deciding) is what makes the final choice actually good.
